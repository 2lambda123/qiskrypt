# Qiskrypt

### About

The [**Qiskrypt**](https://qiskrypt.github.io/) is a software suite of protocols of _quantum cryptography_, built using the [**IBM**](https://www.ibm.com/)â€™s _open-source_ _Software Development Kit_ for _quantum computing_ [**Qiskit**](https://qiskit.org/).

#### Foundation
This _framework_ started as a proposal for the [**IBM**](https://www.ibm.com/) [**Hackathon Europe 2021**](https://qiskithackathoneurope.bemyapp.com/), achieving the 2nd phase of the _Hackathon_ (top 20 teams).

The aim of our _framework_ is to provide all the known _quantum cryptographic protocols_, in a single place, as an accessible solution, and being easy to use.

### Mission
The mission of our framework is to:
* Emphasize the importance of Quantum Cryptography, as a long-term solution for the Post-Quantum Era.
* Provide open-source implementations of quantum cryptographic protocols, including Quantum Key Distributions (QKDs), Semi-Quantum Key Distribution (SQKDs), Quantum Conference Key Agreements (QCKAs), Semi-Quantum Conference Key Agreements (SQCKAs), Quantum One-Time Pads (QOTPs).
* Provide an easy and comprehensive detailed explanation of the protocols addressed, through several illustrations and tutorials.
