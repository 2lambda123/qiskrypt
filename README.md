# Qiskrypt

### About


The [**Qiskrypt**](https://qiskrypt.github.io/) is a software suite of protocols of _quantum cryptography_, built using the [**IBM**](https://www.ibm.com/)’s _open-source_ _Software Development Kit_ for _quantum computing_ [**Qiskit**](https://qiskit.org/).

#### Foundation

This _framework_ started as a proposal for the [**IBM**](https://www.ibm.com/) [**Hackathon Europe 2021**](https://qiskithackathoneurope.bemyapp.com/), achieving the 2nd phase of the _Hackathon_ (top 20 teams) and as, an idea developed as a team of students, researchers and professors, mostly from [**NOVA School of Science and Technology**](https://www.fct.unl.pt/), [**Técnico Lisboa**](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), [**Faculty of Sciences of University of Lisbon**](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en) and [**School of Engineering from University of University of Connecticut**](https://www.engr.uconn.edu/).

The aim of our _framework_ is to provide all the known _quantum cryptographic protocols_, in a single place, as an accessible solution, and being easy to use.

### Mission

The mission of our framework is to:
* Emphasize the importance of _Quantum Cryptography_, as a long-term solution for the _Post-Quantum Era_.
* Provide _open-source_ implementations of _quantum cryptographic protocols_, including **Quantum Key Distributions** (**QKDs**), **Semi-Quantum Key Distribution** (**SQKDs**), **Quantum Conference Key Agreements** (**QCKAs**), **Semi-Quantum Conference Key Agreements** (**SQCKAs**), **Quantum One-Time Pads** (**QOTPs**).
* Provide an easy and comprehensive detailed explanation of the protocols addressed, through several illustrations and tutorials.
